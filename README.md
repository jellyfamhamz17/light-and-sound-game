## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I just used stackoverflow for one issue]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I just could not seem to figure out why the clues were not playing. I checked over the whole program multiple times and even rewrote some parts of and just could not find the reason.
But then as I was looking through it one last time and was ready to give up I noticed that I did not include the function that plays the clue sequence in the the start game function and that solved everything. 
I was also juggling my midterms and several papers while working on this program which forced me to make time for it.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Can I develop complex in-browser games with html, javascript, and CSS together.
Also how do I know when to use global variables and which global variables do I need to use when I do.
And last what is the extent of programs you can create with web dev-ing.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would have definitely customized the buttons, included a timer, changed the speed of clues with every round, randomize the clues every game. I also wanted to make the game a little more complex in the code, 
maybe modernize it a little more so it is not just a simple childrens game but an overall interactive experience. For example improving the graphics, make the buttons move around so it is mopre difficult to remembher the pattern you just have to remember the color and sound, and they move more and after after round of clues. 
Also playing basic songs instead of pitches for each button.]
